# DataPrivacyVR

This little project was developed, by 4 people, during the 10 days bootcamp organized by SEI Inventor, in Turin, 2018.

The idea of this project come in our mind to make people understand what a personal data is, its value and how to protect it.
In the small time, we was able to develop a VR app for Andorid, with the following feature: 
the player is inside a data center and he has to explore the enviroment looking for some pieces of information, collect them in a pc. 
There are 2 types of data: personal data and non-personal data; you have to collect the personal ones but these are encrypted with an
algorithm so you have to find a way to decrypt them before putting inside the pc.
